        <p>Candy Crush Saga was released in 2011 and quickly became one of the five most popular games on Facebook by 2012 and has become a wildly addictive game that has everyone from tweens to seniors under its spell. Hardcore Candy Crush players will know that there is so much more to it than the basic mechanics of a match-three game; there are a wide range of moves you can make and even more combinations of candies that will result in a special candy.</p>
